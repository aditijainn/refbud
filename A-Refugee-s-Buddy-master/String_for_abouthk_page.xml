            Unfortunately, Within HK, Refugees are classified as illegal immigrants, even if their request for asylum is accepted by the government. This is because the UN Refugee convention signed in 1951 by China is not extended to HK and even Macau. Therefore, refugees in HK face an uncertain future. Infact, only around 138 refugees have been accepted by the HK government as of now despite the 14100 living in the city. \n</br>
